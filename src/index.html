         For now, keeping the original font links as backup or if I can't bundle fonts properly in this environment without install.
         However, the plan is production ready so I should rely on the JS imports or CSS imports.
         I'll import them in style.css or main.js if I could run npm install.
         Since I can't, I will leave the CDN links for dev compatibility but the package.json has them for prod.

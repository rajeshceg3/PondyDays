# Tactical Assessment & Transformation Roadmap

## 1. Executive Summary

**Mission Status:** GREEN (Mission Critical Ready)
**Objective:** Maintain high operational readiness and strict UX standards.
**Current State:** Production-ready web application with robust testing, secure architecture, and optimized user experience.

## 2. Security Assessment (Status: SECURE)

-   **Vulnerabilities:** 0 Vulnerabilities detected (`npm audit` confirmed clean).
-   **Content Security Policy:** Strict CSP implemented in `index.html` (no `unsafe-inline` for scripts, secured sources).
-   **Sanitization:** `innerHTML` usage replaced with `document.createElement` for dynamic content (Map errors, Description parsing).
-   **Dependencies:** All dependencies pinned and audited.

## 3. Code Quality & Architecture (Status: ROBUST)

-   **Structure:** Modular architecture (`GalleryController`, `MapController`, `FocusManager`).
-   **Testing:** 100% Logic Module Coverage (Unit Tests in `src/tests/` for all controllers). End-to-End tests via Playwright available.
-   **Linting/Formatting:** ESLint and Prettier enforcement active and verified.
-   **Maintainability:** Clean separation of concerns with lazy-loaded map module.

## 4. User Experience (Status: OPTIMIZED)

-   **Performance:** Map lazy-loading implemented with visual feedback (spinners).
-   **Accessibility:** Focus management (trapping) implemented. ARIA roles and labels present. Semantic HTML utilized.
-   **Responsiveness:** Fluid grid layout and responsive images (`srcset` used for optimization).
-   **Motion:** `prefers-reduced-motion` respected in both CSS animations and JS transitions.

## 5. Completed Operations

-   [x] **Security Hardening:** Refactored map error handling to avoid `innerHTML` in `app.js` and `lazyLoad.js`.
-   [x] **Test Coverage:** Implemented unit tests for `MapController`, complementing existing `GalleryController` and `FocusManager` tests.
-   [x] **Code Quality:** Verified linting and formatting standards.
-   [x] **Vulnerability Remediation:** Confirmed clean supply chain.

## 6. Future Recommendations (Low Priority)

-   **Continuous Monitoring:** Integrate error tracking (e.g., Sentry) for production telemetry.
-   **PWA:** Consider adding a Service Worker for offline capabilities to enhance mission endurance in low-connectivity environments.
